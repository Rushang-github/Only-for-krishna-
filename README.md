# Restaurant Management System - Python

## Overview
This Python-based **Restaurant Management System** allows users to manage restaurant orders efficiently. The system includes basic functionalities such as managing the restaurant menu, taking customer orders, and calculating the total bill. It is designed with simplicity in mind, making it easy to use and extend.

## Features
- **Dynamic Menu Management**: You can add new items to the menu with their respective prices.
- **Order Processing**: Users can place orders by selecting menu items and specifying quantities.
- **Bill Calculation**: The system calculates the total cost of the order and displays the bill.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A menu-driven interface allows users to interact with the system.

## How It Works
The system uses a class `Restaurant` to manage the restaurant's operations. Below is a breakdown of the main components:

### 1. `Restaurant` Class
#### Attributes:
- `menu`: A dictionary that stores menu items as keys and their prices as values.
- `orders`: A list that stores tuples of ordered items and their quantities.

#### Methods:
- **`add_to_menu(item, price)`**: Adds a new item to the restaurant's menu with a specified price.
- **`show_menu()`**: Displays the current menu with item names and their prices.
- **`take_order(item, quantity)`**: Adds an item to the customer's order, including the specified quantity.
- **`calculate_bill()`**: Calculates the total price of all items in the order and prints the final bill.

### 2. `main()` Function
The `main()` function provides a loop for user interaction where they can:
1. Show the restaurant menu.
2. Add items to their order.
3. Calculate and display the total bill.
4. Exit the system.

## How to Run the Program

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x must be installed on your system.

### Steps:
1. Clone or download the Python file to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the program by typing the following command:
   ```bash
   python restaurant_management.py
