# Pong Game in Python

## 🎮 Description

Welcome to the **Pong Game**! This is a classic arcade game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library. In this two-player game, you'll control paddles to keep a ball in play and score points by getting the ball past your opponent. Enjoy the nostalgic feel of the original Pong game!

## 🌟 Features

- **Two-Player Mode**: Challenge a friend and see who can score the most points!
- **Collision Detection**: The ball bounces off walls and paddles for realistic gameplay.
