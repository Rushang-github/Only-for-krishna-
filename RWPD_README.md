## üõ†Ô∏è JavaScript Functionalities

- **Responsive Menu Handling**: 
  - A function is created to toggle the visibility of the navigation menu when the user clicks the menu icon on smaller screens. 
  - This allows the menu to expand or collapse based on user interaction, ensuring a clean and organized interface.

- **Section Highlighter**: 
  - As the user scrolls, a function dynamically updates the active section in the navigation menu.
  - It calculates the scroll position and compares it with the position and height of each section, highlighting the corresponding link in the navigation. 
  - This feedback helps users keep track of their current location on the page.

- **Scroll Header Effects**: 
  - A function changes the appearance of the header when the user scrolls past a specified point (200 pixels).
  - This creates a visual cue that enhances the user's experience, indicating that they have scrolled down the page.

- **Dark Theme Management**: 
  - A function allows users to toggle between light and dark themes with a button click.
  - The user's choice is saved in `localStorage`, so when they return to the website, their preferred theme is automatically applied, providing a consistent experience.

- **Scroll Animations**: 
  - Elements are revealed smoothly as the user scrolls to different sections.
  - This is achieved using the ScrollReveal library, which applies animations based on the user‚Äôs scroll position, creating an engaging and interactive user experience.
