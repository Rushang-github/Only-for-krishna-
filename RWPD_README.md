# Responsive Website Project

This project demonstrates a fully responsive website with features such as a navigation menu, scroll sections, a dark theme switch, and smooth hover effects. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Responsive Navigation Menu**: The navigation adapts to screen sizes and displays a mobile-friendly menu on smaller screens.
- **Scroll Sections**: The website highlights the active section while scrolling, improving user navigation.
- **Dark Mode**: Users can toggle between light and dark themes. The theme choice is saved using `localStorage`.
- **Scroll-to-Top Button**: A button appears after scrolling down, allowing users to quickly return to the top.
- **Smooth Animations**: The website includes smooth reveal animations when scrolling to different sections.

## JavaScript Functionalities

- **Responsive Menu**: Toggles the visibility of the navigation menu on smaller screens.
- **Section Highlighter**: Dynamically updates the active section in the menu as the user scrolls.
- **Scroll Header**: Changes the appearance of the header when the user scrolls past a certain point.
- **Dark Theme Toggle**: Allows users to switch between light and dark themes.
- **Scroll Animations**: Elements appear smoothly when the user scrolls to different sections.

## How It Works

1. **Navigation Menu**: 
   - The menu can be toggled open or closed by clicking the menu icon on smaller screens.
   - When a menu item is clicked, the menu closes automatically.
   
2. **Dark Mode**:
   - The theme is saved using `localStorage`, so the user's preference is maintained across sessions.

3. **Scroll-to-Top**:
   - A button is displayed after scrolling down 560 pixels, allowing users to return to the top of the page easily.

## Technologies Used

- CSS (for styling and responsiveness)

2. Explore the responsive features by resizing the window or opening it on a mobile device.
3. Toggle between light and dark themes using the sun/moon button.
